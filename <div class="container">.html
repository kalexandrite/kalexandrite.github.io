                        <h4>Future Telling Asssignment Requirements</h4>
                   <p>Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have been working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling” freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc.<p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating some sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time you arrive to class in order to workshop them with your peers.</p>
                   <p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about formatting we can address them Monday before they go live.</p></p>

                        <p>Overall goal: To develop 4 static web pages that function as narrative elements (building blocks) using the idea of the storytelling decks. These should have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or be 4 completely different designs with internal consistency.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>We will be using our initial HTML and CSS skills to work together in a
                            program called Twine towards developing a narrative, game, or
                            experience using this free application. The project will employ your individual imagery and ideas from our future telling assignment, woven together with
                            supplementary material that the group will provide to create a cohesive narrative or game.</p>
                            
                           <p> This assignment will be graded on how well you have integrated your
                            materials into a synthesized whole, the design motivations and
                            execution and the level of customization and game play you program.
                            Further details will be provided in class and an assignment sheet will be
                            made collectively towards developing a grading rubric.</p>
