                        <h4>>Your homework this week is to work on your project proposal.</h4>


<p>For your midterm I am going to ask that for this assignment you use only HTML and CSS unless you have specifically discussed with me how you will be using javascript and why it is necessary (and why it can not be added later.)</p>

<p>(Collaboration is possible/encouraged, please discuss with me before submitting the proposal however.)</p>

<p>This assignment is highly independent but will incorporate the coding and design work we have been doing toward your own content/interests etc.</p>

<p>Your proposal should consider the motivation, audience, values, narrative, context and design influences and inspirations that motivate it.</p>

<p>Proposals may be written and drawn and should cite relevant influences or sources, along with naming the kind of document structure that will be used for shaping the design.</p>

<p>Planning and collecting inspiration will be important towards communicating your ideas and you are encouraged to include as much material as you can collect or generate (even if it is pointing towards experimental processes rather than results) towards helping convey what you aspire to build and present it with your proposal.</p>

    <p><b>4 files in progress September 12th in class,</b></p>
    <p><b>Class Critique September 19th (Mon)</b></p>
    <p>Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have been
        working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling”
        freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc.</p>
    <p>These pages should be designed similar to custom tarot decks, and either have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or
        be 4 completely different designs with internal consistency.</p>
    <p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating some
        sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time you arrive
        to class in order to workshop them with your peers.</p>
    <p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about
        formatting we can address them Monday before they go live.</p>
    <p>An assignment sheet will be provided.</p>
