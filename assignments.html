    </h3>
    <p>Reach out to at least 3 people from your community (at home, where family is, where you want to live, where you grew up). Try to find out what internet service is available in their area. What kind of connections are offered (cable, dial-up, fiber, ?) Ask the oldest person you can get ahold of when they first remember the internet being used and, if they have access, how and what they use it for. Ask the youngest person you know the same questions. Then find at least one person in your field, or at least research to the best you can and try to determine how they use the internet, web design, or web communication. Ideally you will feel able to understand how the internet functions both for your community and in the field that you will be working in. Consider who is left out of this research and what requirements the “normal” technology obligate.</p>
