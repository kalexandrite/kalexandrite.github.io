      <h4>Due Before Class, August 31, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
      </p>
      <p>Reach out to at least 3 people from your community (at home, where family is, where you want to live, where you
        grew up). Try to find out what internet service is available in their area. What kind of connections are offered
        (cable, dial-up, fiber, ?) Ask the oldest person you can get ahold of when they first remember the internet
        being
        used and, if they have access, how and what they use it for. Ask the youngest person you know the same
        questions.
        Then find at least one person in your field, or at least research to the best you can and try to determine how
        they use the internet, web design, or web communication. Ideally you will feel able to understand how the
        internet
        functions both for your community and in the field that you will be working in. Consider who is left out of this
        research and what requirements the “normal” technology obligate.</p>

      <h4>Due in Class, September 7th, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
      </p>
      <p>Think about our conversation on Wednesday and our excitement about the possibilities of the internet and
        designing for the web differently. Can you dream about <i>who</i> and <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> you want to
        empower through your designs on the internet? What does that sound, feel, or look like? Collect up images,
        words, and texts that will function as the material of an archive for a future you want to design.</p>

      <p>Find and bring to class at least 5 images and 3 texts, these can be anything you have seen, drawn, found, read,
        written, and mostly anything else you can collect in some way. These don't necessarily have to be digital. We
        will be discussing how to digitize images and image formats in class. This is also the start of our fortune
        telling project, and the material you collect will be used toward our next project, so ideally the texts and
        images are ones you are comfortable sharing with the class.</p>

      <p>

        <h3>Internet Inspector Exploded (10pts (Wed)</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
      <h4>Class Critique - September 12th (Mon)</h4>
      </p>
      <p> Using the "inspect element" tool, and the "web developer console" in Firefox or Chrome, find a few web pages
        that use
        html in the design in such a way that you have code/contenet/elements to modify. Pick a few pages and make
        changes to the text, color,
        layout, font or any element that changes our understanding of the website using the sample code linked and your
        own inventions.
        For this assignment you will screenshot the before and after layout of the websites, along with the inspector
        that shows the modified code. <i> All of the individual elements below are from the <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">www3 HTML tutorial page</a> </i></p>

        <h4>Future Telling Asssignment Requirements</h4>
        <p>Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have been
          working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling”
          freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc.</p>
        <p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating
          some sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time you
          arrive to class in order to workshop them with your peers.</p>
        <p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about
          formatting we can address them Monday before they go live.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Overall goal: To develop 4 static web pages that function as narrative elements (building blocks) using
              the idea of the storytelling decks. These should have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or be 4 completely
              different designs with internal consistency.</p>

              Use inline and block HTML elements to format text in your page: paragraphs, ordered or unordered lists,

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use proper html syntax and semantic markup to give your page a hierarchical structure Use proper semantic
              markup to give your page a hierarchical structure (e.g. an
              <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
              element for the main heading of the page, and
              <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
              and
              <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>

            <p>Develop a pattern/background from an image and upload this image to an images folder to githubpages.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Display this and at least one other image on your page using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the alt attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to describe the image for those who might
              be unable to see it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add some CSS inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of
              your document to modify the design of your page (text color, text font family, page background color, etc)
              or add a separate CSS page to format. </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add at least one custom google font.</p>
          </li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pick one page to be the main page and link the others from there or make a landing page that links to the 4
          pages so they are viewable online for the class critique.</p>
      </li>

        towards communicating your ideas and you are encouraged to include as much material as you can collect or

        are using a special javascript library, or a font collection that has a historical connection to your material -
        either of those are worthy of presenting to the class. Assignment detail will be provided with the final project
