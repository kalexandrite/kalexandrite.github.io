        <h4>Due Before Class, August 31, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
        </p>
        <p>Reach out to at least 3 people from your community (at home, where family is, where you want to live, where
          you
          grew up). Try to find out what internet service is available in their area. What kind of connections are
          offered
          (cable, dial-up, fiber, ?) Ask the oldest person you can get ahold of when they first remember the internet
          being
          used and, if they have access, how and what they use it for. Ask the youngest person you know the same
          questions.
          Then find at least one person in your field, or at least research to the best you can and try to determine how
          they use the internet, web design, or web communication. Ideally you will feel able to understand how the
          internet
          functions both for your community and in the field that you will be working in. Consider who is left out of
          this
          research and what requirements the “normal” technology obligate.</p>

        <h4>Due in Class, September 7th, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
        </p>
        <p>Think about our conversation on Wednesday and our excitement about the possibilities of the internet and
          designing for the web differently. Can you dream about <i>who</i> and <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> you want to
          empower through your designs on the internet? What does that sound, feel, or look like? Collect up images,
          words, and texts that will function as the material of an archive for a future you want to design.</p>

        <p>Find and bring to class at least 5 images and 3 texts, these can be anything you have seen, drawn, found,
          read, written, and mostly anything else you can collect in some way. These don't necessarily have to be
          digital. We will be discussing how to digitize images and image formats in class. This is also the start of
          our fortune telling project, and the material you collect will be used toward our next project, so ideally the
          texts and images are ones you are comfortable sharing with the class.</p>

        <h4>Class Critique - September 12th (Mon)</h4>
        </p>
        <p> Using the "inspect element" tool, and the "web developer console" in Firefox or Chrome, find a few web pages
          that use
          html in the design in such a way that you have code/contenet/elements to modify. Pick a few pages and make
          changes to the text, color,
          layout, font or any element that changes our understanding of the website using the sample code linked and
          your
          own inventions.
          For this assignment you will screenshot the before and after layout of the websites, along with the inspector
          that shows the modified code. <i> All of the individual elements below are from the <a

        <h4>Future Telling Asssignment Requirements</h4>

        <p>Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have
          been working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling”
          freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc.</p>

        <p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating
          some sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time
          you arrive to class in order to workshop them with your peers.</p>

        <p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about
          formatting we can address them Monday before they go live.</p>

        <ol>

          <li>
            <p>Overall goal: To develop 4 static web pages that function as narrative elements (building blocks) using
              the idea of the storytelling decks. These should have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or be 4
              completely
              different designs with internal consistency.</p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Use inline and block HTML elements to format text in your page: paragraphs, ordered or unordered lists,
              underline and highlight text. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use proper html syntax and semantic markup to give your page a hierarchical structure Use proper
              semantic
              markup to give your page a hierarchical structure (e.g. an
              <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
              element for the main heading of the page, and
              <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
              and
              <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
              elements to designate subheadings)..
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Develop a pattern/background from an image and upload this image to an images folder to githubpages.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>Display this and at least one other image on your page using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the alt attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to describe the image for those who might
              be unable to see it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add some CSS inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of
              your document to modify the design of your page (text color, text font family, page background color,
              etc)
              or add a separate CSS page to format. </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add at least one custom google font.</p>
          </li>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Pick one page to be the main page and link the others from there or make a landing page that links to the
              4
              pages so they are viewable online for the class critique.</p>
          </li>

          <p>Groups will present their project to eachother in order to test functionality and get feedback on their
            design.
            The
            assignment is graded on preparedness and group participation.</p>

          <h4>Final Critique in Class: October 3rd, 2022 (Mon)</h4>

          <p>Using our initial Coding and CSS skills we will be working together in a program called <a
              href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> towards developing a narrative, game, or
            experience using this free application. The project will employ your individual imagery and ideas from our
            future telling assignment, woven together with
            supplementary material that the group will provide to create a cohesive narrative or game</p>
          <p>This assignment will be graded on how well you have integrated your materials into a synthesized whole, the
            design motivations and execution and the level of customization and game play you program. We will be
            discussing
            the idea of choreography and the kind of spaces we create as a way of orienting ourselves towards
            accessibility
            and contending and appreciating difference. How will your group find an identity that is specific and which
            also
            addresses some of the internal differences in a way that both appreciates this task without defaulting to
            normalizing, or erasing the variation of aesthetics and narrative interests? The class rubric for this
            assignment will be developed collectively. </p>

          <h3>Notes on Twine Assignment:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Install Twine on your computer. Make sure to choose the download that corresponds to your computer.
              macOS
              for Mac or Windows.exe for windows. Make sure you are using version 2.5.1
            </li>
            <li> Move the application to your applications folder.</li>
            <li>Open twine. We will be using the story format called SugarCube. To change the default story format,
              select
              its card in the Story Formats screen and choose <i>Use as Default Format</i> from the <i>Story Format</i>
              top toolbar tab. A “Use as Default” sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change. We will be
              using
              SugarCube as the story format.</li>

          <p>For next week, and to help you with the proposal I am assigning these tutorials and will be updating the

          <p>Read: Ayush Gupta’s <a

          </ul>

          <p>For your midterm I am going to ask that for this assignment you use only HTML and CSS unless you have
            specifically discussed with me how you will be using javascript and why it is necessary (and why it can not
            be added later.)</p>

          <p>(Collaboration is possible/encouraged, please discuss with me before submitting the proposal however.)</p>

          <p>This assignment is highly independent but will incorporate the coding and design work we have been doing
            toward your own content/interests etc.</p>

          <p>Your proposal should consider the motivation, audience, values, narrative, context and design influences
            and inspirations that motivate it.</p>

          <p>Proposals may be written and drawn and should cite relevant influences or sources, along with naming the
            kind of document structure that will be used for shaping the design.</p>

          <p>Planning and collecting inspiration will be important towards communicating your ideas and you are
            encouraged to include as much material as you can collect or generate (even if it is pointing towards
            experimental processes rather than results) towards helping convey what you aspire to build and present it
            with your proposal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Please have your midterm project uploaded to github pages and ready to present to the class.</p>
    </div>
    </p>

    <h3></h3>Peer evaluation for the midterm </h3>
    <p>The midterm project should include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 1 HTML page, and one or more CSS files
      </li>
      <li>CSS Typography (Google Fonts, relative sizing using em and rem units)
      </li>
      <li>CSS Grid and/or Flex-based layout
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Standard HTML5 code for viewport </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attributed Media (img, audio, video, or iframe) and content that form coherent objective
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Your projects should be posted by 5 pm Friday October 21st. Evaluations will be due Monday October 24th</h3>
    <p>The midterms grade will be considered in relationship to the critique you provide of your own site, the
      description of what your project required (rather in coding or in other areas of research and development). Please
      include what you feel you would do differently, add or want to expand. Along with your own evaluation you will
      also evaluate the project of 2 of your peers - which I will assign to you. </p>
    <p>I will review these critiques and provide you with a final feedback sheet that includes some of these responses
      as well as a grade that reflects your work, and the evaluation and understanding of you and your peers work. You
      may choose to keep these critiques anonymous, though I will provide the helpful and useful elements in the
      summaries of these evaluations. </p>
    <p>In the case that you are assigned someone’s project who has used code you are not familiar with, you may speak to
      me to inquire about where to learn more. These critiques are are open to research and are an opportunity to learn
      from your peer’s work and gain feedback from those learning along with you.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Written Critique of Midterm (1 separate page per project, submitted as Word document, 1.5 space, Avenir 12 pt
      type.) </p>
    <p>Aim to write a few sentences on each of these area, and use constructive criticisms - illustrated if possible
      with screen shots and specific code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aesthetics: what are your personal, embodied impressions, as a viewer/reader/listener of the project,
        considering what you experience as you navigate and what this conveys about what you believe they are trying to
        communicate and/or accomplish?
      </li>
      <li>Accessibility, Readability and Ease-of-Use: Describe the project’s imagined or potential audience based on the
        design of the page. How does it render on your phone? Or a tablet if you have one? Is there anything that you
        consider specifically assistive, or difficult for some users? Does the text meet standards for readability? With
        these ideas in mind, what suggestions do you have for improving the reach of the project? *
      </li>
      <li>Technique: Download the project from GitHub or open the browser inspector. Is the HTML/CSS/JS readable? Can
        you understand what is being executed by looking at it? Does the organization and formatting make sense and seem
        efficient and logical? Is there a function that you didn’t know about being used? Are HTML tags used properly
        with regard to semantics?
      </li>
      <li>Ethics. Are there privacy, attribution of content or authorship of code concerns you are noticing? What kind
        of representation or inclusion is present, and how does this relate in regards to their audience? Do you have
        any specific comments that may assist in helping your fellow student understand something that may be culturally
        ambiguous, or have a valence they perhaps are not aware of? Is there something they are doing that feels
        especially inclusive (even if it is subtle, if upon reflection you realize you had this reaction it is worth
        noting.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please make sure to post your projects on GitHub and link them on piazza so that your classmates can find them.

        <li>Are you expanding on a previous project for your final? If so, please describe what aspects of your project
          you plan to expand and why. If not, please describe your final project and how it is an expansion of your
          skills and meets some goal you have for communication or art on the internet or in a networked media sense?
        </li>
        <li>What ideas that relate to the social implications and influence of technology on communication and social
          imagination are influencing your choice of this project? Please think back to initial readings and questions
          we have asked over the course of the class - or have not asked enough - regarding audience, accessibility,
          communicating with design etc. <i>(This does not have to be something you are confident you understand - it is
            great if it to be something you want to learn more about.)</i>

          you are imagining and or influences and inspirations for this design.

        <li>Find at least 2-3 other art, design, code libraries or theoretical works you think may relate to your
          project. Write a short paragraph describing it and try to relate it to something you understand about your own
          work. Choose one of these to research more in depth to present to the class. This will be a short presentation
          and will be about 4 minutes - and be a resource for your peers on piazza.

        <li>Create a timeline for the rest of the class and write out what you will have accomplished by each class
