        <p>
        <h4>Due Before Class, August 31, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
        </p>
        <p>Reach out to at least 3 people from your community (at home, where family is, where you want to live, where
          you
          grew up). Try to find out what internet service is available in their area. What kind of connections are
          offered
          (cable, dial-up, fiber, ?) Ask the oldest person you can get ahold of when they first remember the internet
          being
          used and, if they have access, how and what they use it for. Ask the youngest person you know the same
          questions.
          Then find at least one person in your field, or at least research to the best you can and try to determine how
          they use the internet, web design, or web communication. Ideally you will feel able to understand how the
          internet
          functions both for your community and in the field that you will be working in. Consider who is left out of
          this
          research and what requirements the “normal” technology obligate.</p>

        <h4>Due in Class, September 7th, 2022 (Wed)</h4>
        </p>
        <p>Think about our conversation on Wednesday and our excitement about the possibilities of the internet and
          designing for the web differently. Can you dream about <i>who</i> and <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> you want to
          empower through your designs on the internet? What does that sound, feel, or look like? Collect up images,
          words, and texts that will function as the material of an archive for a future you want to design.</p>

        <p>Find and bring to class at least 5 images and 3 texts, these can be anything you have seen, drawn, found,
          read, written, and mostly anything else you can collect in some way. These don't necessarily have to be
          digital. We will be discussing how to digitize images and image formats in class. This is also the start of
          our fortune telling project, and the material you collect will be used toward our next project, so ideally the
          texts and images are ones you are comfortable sharing with the class.</p>

        <h4>Class Critique - September 12th (Mon)</h4>
        </p>
        <p> Using the "inspect element" tool, and the "web developer console" in Firefox or Chrome, find a few web pages
          that use
          html in the design in such a way that you have code/contenet/elements to modify. Pick a few pages and make
          changes to the text, color,
          layout, font or any element that changes our understanding of the website using the sample code linked and
          your
          own inventions.
          For this assignment you will screenshot the before and after layout of the websites, along with the inspector
          that shows the modified code. <i> All of the individual elements below are from the <a

        <h4>Future Telling Asssignment Requirements</h4>

        <p>Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have
          been working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling”
          freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc.</p>

        <p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating
          some sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time
          you arrive to class in order to workshop them with your peers.</p>

        <p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about
          formatting we can address them Monday before they go live.</p>

        <ol>

          <li>
            <p>Overall goal: To develop 4 static web pages that function as narrative elements (building blocks) using
              the idea of the storytelling decks. These should have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or be 4
              completely
              different designs with internal consistency.</p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Use inline and block HTML elements to format text in your page: paragraphs, ordered or unordered lists,
              underline and highlight text. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use proper html syntax and semantic markup to give your page a hierarchical structure Use proper
              semantic
              markup to give your page a hierarchical structure (e.g. an
              <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
              element for the main heading of the page, and
              <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
              and
              <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
              elements to designate subheadings)..
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Develop a pattern/background from an image and upload this image to an images folder to githubpages.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>Display this and at least one other image on your page using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the alt attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to describe the image for those who might
              be unable to see it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add some CSS inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of
              your document to modify the design of your page (text color, text font family, page background color,
              etc)
              or add a separate CSS page to format. </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add at least one custom google font.</p>
          </li>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Pick one page to be the main page and link the others from there or make a landing page that links to the
              4
              pages so they are viewable online for the class critique.</p>
          </li>

    <h4>Grading Rubric and Group Assignments: September 26th (Mon)

    </h4>
    <p>Groups will be to conceptualize the Twine project and set up a group Git Repository (or develop an alternative
      working method for the project) during class. As you set up your project look for what technical help you need in
      order to work towards the in-progress game/poem/project for September 28th (Wed) by working together outside of
      class.</p>

    <h4>In Progress Critique in Class: September 28th (Wed)</h4>

    <p>Groups will present their project to eachother in order to test functionality and get feedback on their design.
      The
      assignment is graded on preparedness and group participation.</p>

    <h4>Final Critique in Class: October 3rd, 2022 (Mon)</h4>

    <p>Using our initial Coding and CSS skills we will be working together in a program called <a
        href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> towards developing a narrative, game, or
      experience using this free application. The project will employ your individual imagery and ideas from our
      future telling assignment, woven together with
      supplementary material that the group will provide to create a cohesive narrative or game</p>
    <p>This assignment will be graded on how well you have integrated your materials into a synthesized whole, the
      design motivations and execution and the level of customization and game play you program. We will be discussing
      the idea of choreography and the kind of spaces we create as a way of orienting ourselves towards accessibility
      and contending and appreciating difference. How will your group find an identity that is specific and which also
      addresses some of the internal differences in a way that both appreciates this task without defaulting to
      normalizing, or erasing the variation of aesthetics and narrative interests? The class rubric for this
      assignment will be developed collectively. </p>

    <h3>Notes on Twine Assignment:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Twine on your computer. Make sure to choose the download that corresponds to your computer. macOS
        for Mac or Windows.exe for windows. Make sure you are using version 2.5.1
      </li>
      <li> Move the application to your applications folder.</li>
      <li>Open twine. We will be using the story format called SugarCube. To change the default story format, select
        its card in the Story Formats screen and choose <i>Use as Default Format</i> from the <i>Story Format</i>
        top toolbar tab. A “Use as Default” sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change. We will be using
        SugarCube as the story format.</li>

    <h4>Javascript, the next coding laguage we will explore, is about actions. Think about this Twine assignment as a
      way to develop a method for approaching navigation and dynamic action by thinking about accessibility and
      legibility for the user in relationship to the content and context you are designing.</h4>

      <h4 id="Your homework this week is to work on your project proposal.">Your homework this week is to work on your project proposal.</h4>

<p>For next week, and to help you with the proposal I am assigning these tutorials and will be updating the website with them as well:</p>

<p>Read: Ayush Gupta’s <a href="https://medium.com/youstart-labs/beginners-guide-to-choose-between-css-grid-and-flexbox-783005dd2412">“Beginner’s Guide To CSS Grid And Flexbox”</a></p>

</li><li>  <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/">“Flexbox”</a> from <i>HTML & CSS Is Hard</i>
</li><li>  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks’ “A Complete Guide to Flexbox”</a>
</li></ul>

<p>And</p>

<ul><li>  Experiment with the <a href="https://learnflexbox.org/">Learn Flexbox</a> sandbox environment
</li><li>  Watch some of the <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/video/">Free Learn Grid Layout video series</a>
</li></ul>

<p>For your midterm I am going to ask that for this assignment you use only HTML and CSS unless you have specifically discussed with me how you will be using javascript and why it is necessary (and why it can not be added later.)</p>

<p>(Collaboration is possible/encouraged, please discuss with me before submitting the proposal however.)</p>

<p>This assignment is highly independent but will incorporate the coding and design work we have been doing toward your own content/interests etc.</p>

<p>Your proposal should consider the motivation, audience, values, narrative, context and design influences and inspirations that motivate it.</p>

<p>Proposals may be written and drawn and should cite relevant influences or sources, along with naming the kind of document structure that will be used for shaping the design.</p>

<p>Planning and collecting inspiration will be important towards communicating your ideas and you are encouraged to include as much material as you can collect or generate (even if it is pointing towards experimental processes rather than results) towards helping convey what you aspire to build and present it with your proposal.</p>
