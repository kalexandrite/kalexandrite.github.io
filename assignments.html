<div class="highlight2"><h3>Community Field Research: “personal history of the internet”(10pts)</h3></div>
<h4><p>Due Before Class, August 31, 2022 (Wed)</p></h4>

<p>Reach out to at least 3 people from your community (at home, where family is, where you want to live, where you grew up). Try to find out what internet service is available in their area. What kind of connections are offered (cable, dial-up, fiber, ?) Ask the oldest person you can get ahold of when they first remember the internet being used and, if they have access, how and what they use it for. Ask the youngest person you know the same questions. Then find at least one person in your field, or at least research to the best you can and try to determine how they use the internet, web design, or web communication. Ideally you will feel able to understand how the internet functions both for your community and in the field that you will be working in. Consider who is left out of this research and what requirements the “normal” technology obligate.</p>

<div class="highlight2"><h3>Internet Explorer Exploded  (10pts)</h3></div>
<h4>
  <p>Class Critique : September 7th (Wed)</p>
</h4>
<p>Using the inspect tool in internet explorer, find web pages that use html and css heavily enough that they can be modified. Pick 4-8 pages and make changes to the text, color, layout, font or any element that changes our understanding of the website. For this assignment you will screenshot the before and after of the website, along with the inspector that shows the modified code. </p>

<div class="highlight2"><h3>Individual Assignment - Future Telling (20pts - In progress/Final)</h3></div>
<h4><p>4 files in progress September 12th in class, </p></h4>
<h4><p>Class Critique September 19th (Mon)</p></h4>

<p> Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS which you have learned in the tutorials and the concepts we have been working on in class, along with your collected dream images and text you will design 4 “future telling” freestanding web pages that use unique fonts, uploaded images, gifs, patterns etc. </p>
<p>These pages should be designed similar to custom tarot decks, and either have a consistent thematic aesthetic, or be 4 completely different designs with internal consistency. </p>
<p>In doing your work, think about the pattern, color, placement of text, and the composition as communicating some sort of foretelling, the beginning of a narrative. These files should be almost completed by the time you arrive to class in order to workshop them with your peers. </p>
<p>You will be uploading your webpages on Wednesday the14th during class and if you have any questions about formatting we can address them Monday before they go live. </p>
<p>An assignment sheet will be provided.</p>

<div class="highlight2"><h3>Group Project - Future telling becomes Collective (20pts - In progress/Final)</h3></div>
<h4><p>In progress due: September 21st (Wed) </p>
  <p>Final Critique in Class: September 28, 2022 (Wed)</p></h4>

<p>We will be using our initial HTML and CSS skills to work together in a program called Twine towards developing a narrative, game, or experience of some sort that will use your individual imagery and ideas from our future telling assignment to woven together with supplementary material. </p>
<p>This assignment will be graded on how well you have integrated your materials into a synthesized whole, the design motivations and execution and the level of customization and game play you program.  Further details will be provided in class and an assignment sheet will be made collectively towards developing a grading rubric. </p>

<div class="highlight2"><h3>Project proposal for Midterm: (10pts)</h3></div>
<h4><p>Due October 5, 2022 (Wed) in class </p></h4>
<p>(Collaboration is possible/encouraged, please discuss with me before submitting the proposal however.)</p>
<p>This assignment is highly independent but will incorporate the coding and design work we have been doing toward your own content/interests etc. Your proposal should consider the motivation, audience, values, narrative, context and design influences and inspirations that motivate it. Planning and collecting inspiration will be important towards communicating your ideas and you are encouraged to include as much material as you can collect or generate (even if it is pointing towards experimental processes rather than results) towards helping convey what you aspire to build. </p>

<p>This will be an in class assignment to help you think outside of the frame you have been working in with your midterm. Please bring coded material to class and have it uploaded to your GitHub. </p>
<p>Using p5.Js  or an alternate experimental coding platform see if you can exchange elements of your midterm projects with each other towards experimenting with them as material. This will be a quick assignment and having midterm material available and participation is all that is necessary to receive the grade. </p>
